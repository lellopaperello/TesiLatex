Navier-Stokes

\subsection{Incompressible Navier - Stokes}

SU2 solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a general form allowing for variable density due to heat transfer through the low-Mach approximation (or incompressible ideal gas formulation). The equations can be expressed in differential form as 
\begin{equation}
